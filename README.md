# UtiliKit

UtiliKit is a [Swift Package](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) containing assorted code that I share across projects. There is no particular theme to the contents. If I use something in more than one project, it is likely to end up here.

### Libraries

The package contains the following libraries:

#### UtiliKit

Broadly reusable code.

#### CheckersKit

A framework fo implementing Checkers-like games with SpriteKit. A Checkers-like game has four primary attributes:

1. Two players
2. Only one type of piece for each player
3. Game play involves moving the pieces around a board
4. Turn-based

The game doesn't have to be related to the actual game of Checkers.

This library has my own branding (i.e, the visual style of the game and the app) baked in. If you find something useful here, you should probably copy the code to your own repo, so you can edit the look to match your style.
